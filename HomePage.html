      <h2>Select a Quiz:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="./Python/Python.html"><strong>Python:</strong> </a>It is a versatile and widely-used programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It emphasizes code readability with its clean and straightforward syntax, making it an excellent choice for beginners and experienced developers alike. Python's extensive standard library and vast community support make it suitable for various applications, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, automation, and more.</li>
        <li><a href="./Java/Java.html"><strong>Java:</strong></a> It is a popular, robust, and platform-independent programming language. It's renowned for its "write once, run anywhere" capability, allowing developers to create applications that can run on different operating systems without modification. Java's object-oriented nature promotes modular and maintainable code, while its strong type system helps catch errors at compile time. It's widely used in enterprise software, Android app development, and web applications.</li>
        <li><a href="./JavaScript/JavaScript.html"><strong>JavaScript:</strong></a> It is a dynamic scripting language primarily used for web development. It's the backbone of interactivity on the web, enabling developers to create responsive user interfaces, dynamic content, and animations. JavaScript can be run directly in web browsers, making it accessible to users without any additional installations. With the advent of Node.js, JavaScript can also be used for server-side programming, allowing developers to use a single language for both client and server development.</li>
        <li><a href="./HTML/HTML.html"><strong>HTML:</strong> </a>It is not a programming language but rather a markup language used to structure content on the web. It defines the structure of web pages by using a set of elements, each with specific meanings and properties. HTML elements are used to create headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, forms, and more. When combined with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity, HTML forms the core of web development, enabling the creation of visually appealing and interactive websites.</li>
